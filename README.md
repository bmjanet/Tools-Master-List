# Red-Teaming-Tools-Master-List
This is a conglomerate of tools I've created or used to keep hold of.

in reality, this is a list of all the tools and stuff I've used in CTFs or found research on in order to keep track. Credit is given where credit is due because I don't want to steal anyone's intellectual property :)
